This repo is part of my work in NLP to find important phrases from given statement. <br>
This repo has complete code but it doesn't give proper result as I am not having enough data to create vocab. As of now, this work uses `en_core_web_lg` from `Spacy` to find similarity in text. 
This can be better trained with `Word2Vec` with `gensim` to get far better results for this task given that we have enough data to train our system. <br><br>
In case you find good dataset for task, do let me know on Twitter @Siddharth1India and I can add you as contributor. <br>
Given good data, this project can be extended to many important usecases in real-world like extracting information from various data sources which actually matters rather than spending time reading useless text data.

For any further queries, please open issue, I will respond within hours.
